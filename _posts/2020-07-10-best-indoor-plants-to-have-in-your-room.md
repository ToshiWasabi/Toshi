Hi, Seedlings! It has been a while since I shared my first blog. How are you doing? Hope you are all safe. Despite the terrible things happening around the world and as we continue to brave this pandemic, I am praying that you still manage to take care of yourselves.

It is indeed during these appalling times that we struggle in sustaining our overall well-being. However, I am certain that we could also think of many ways that could help us somehow relieve the immensity of our current situation.

When we think about de-stressing one of the first things that come to mind is to be in our safe space ‚Äì alone in our own private spot, where we can just rest and relax. Safe space could be a physical or metaphorical place for us; This is where we could freely express ourselves without the fear of judgments or harm. If I were to ask you what part of your home you would consider your safe space, I bet you‚Äôd answer: bedroom.

The bedroom has always been (if not one of) the first place most of us go to when things get a little overwhelming. It is because we know that it is the only space that we have control over. As for me, my bedroom helps me unwind and reflect on myself. It is where I usually go when I need to contemplate or just simply be alone. Staying in my room for the past weeks has allowed me to wind down; As I was trying to meditate I figured out a way to make my bedroom look more soothing and relaxing ‚Äì which is to add plants in it.

There are myriad of health benefits that bedroom plants can bring; Aside from their air-purifying properties, they can also help alleviate stress and promote good sleep. However, it is essential to consider what plants to put in your room. To help you decide what plants would perfectly match your room, here is to give you my top 3-bedroom plants and their perks:

**_Dieffenbachia amoena a.k.a ‚ÄúDumb Cane‚Äù_**

- One of the most common and popular variegated (or multi-colored) houseplants.
- Absorbs Carbon Dioxide and purifies air efficiently.
- Adds a tropical look to your room.
- Easy to take care and maintain since it only requires partial shade of sunlight, makes it the perfect indoor plant.

Things to take note:

- Do not touch the sap or the secretion of the plant. It is poisonous, which can cause skin irritation and swelling of the throat. Keep it away from the reach of children and pets.
- Research on safety and first aid measures you can do for dumb cane poisoning.

- Removes harmful pollutants in the air such as benzene, carbon monoxide, xylene, etc.
