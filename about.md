Hey there, I’m Merry. Yes, you read that right, Merry as in Merry Christmas. I guess my parents decided to name me that because I’ve always been jolly since I was little. I’m 25 years old and currently studying BS Pharmacy at a university in the Philippines.

And since I’ve mentioned Pharmacy, this brings us to a quick background on my username: Bowl of Hygieia pronounced as hahy-jee-uh. If you google Bowl of Hygieia you’d find out that it is one of the most important symbols of Pharmacy and medicine in western countries. While Hygieia is the name of the Greek goddess of health hygiene. However, there’s a quite different meaning it has for me when I chose this as my username.

Bowl serves as a container –something that can hold things. As for Hygieia which translates to hygiene, conveys self-care. I chose “Bowl of Hygieia” because I intend to use this page as a “bowl” of resources that will (hopefully) help people attain optimal self-care.

Self-care is very crucial to our health and well-being, especially in this modern time – where everything is fast-paced. It’s hard to maintain something in an environment that is quickly and vastly changing. So, how do we maintain balanced emotional, mental, and physical health? – well, there are tons of ways according to health experts such as getting enough sleep, exercise, meditate, etc. But this page aims to suggest/offer other creative ways to attain self-care – one of such is planting.

As someone who has struggled with self-care, I can attest that planting has helped me overcome my anxieties. It was during my trip to Bangkok, Thailand that inspired me to try planting. I was astounded with their fresh herbs and ornamental plants – the experience was calming and relaxing as I strolled around looking at different plants. When I came home, I started planting, since then, I’ve never been happier and focused.

This wonderful experience is exactly what I want to share with you. Please join me in this halcyon adventure of planting. Together, let us discover anything that there is to learn about plants while preserving or achieving ideal self-care. I cannot wait to start this exciting journey with you!
